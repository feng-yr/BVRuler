# BVRuler

BVRuler : A binocular vision ranging system based on OpenCV

* It is based on OpenCV. This means that you can get all the source code and transplant it to all platforms supported by OpenCV.
* It can automatically detect objects and calculate the distance between objects and cameras.
* Ranging accuracy is high and the error is generally at centimeter level. Since the specific range and precision is related to camera parameters, calibration accuracy and applied scenarios, the final effect is determined by specific circumstances.
